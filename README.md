# Dental-Clinic-Database
This Information Systems and Databases project concerns the development of an information system supporting the day-to-day operations of a dental clinic. A database and several webpages were created to store and access the information about clinics employees (doctors, nurses, receptionists...), clients, appointments and procedures. 

# E-R Model 
An E-R model was first developed. The scheme containing the model can be accessed through the folder docs, in the file "E_R_Model.pdf". Moreover, the Relational Model and a set of non-trivial design decisions are also presented in the same file.

# Database
The code used to create the tables and insert information to the database is presented in the file createtables.sql. Detailed information about the tables and the initial information added can be accessed through the docs folder in the file "Create_Tables_Detailed_Info.pdf". 

# Web Pages
The landing page is a search page where information for different clients can be accessed. After searching for clients, a list containing all the clients and a link to create appointments/consultations for each of them is shown. If you desire to create a new appointment, it takes it to a page to select a date and a time for the appointment. Once selected, the website will direct you to a page where a Doctor is selected and a description of the appointment is added. Once the description is added, an appointment is created, and the user is redirected to the initial search page. 

If the user can also see a list of all the consultations and appointments for that particular client. It is also possible to see detailed information about a particular appointment or consultation by selecting the link "GET INFO" on the respective tables. Besides, it is also possible to add information to an appointment and convert it into consultation by selecting the reference "+ADD info".

When seeing all the detailed information about a particular consultation if it has a "dental charting" type of procedure, it is possible to add information regarding a description and measure of a single tooth by selecting the reference "Edit Info".

More information about the web pages can be accessed through the docs folder in the "Web_Pages_Detailed_Info.pdf" file.
